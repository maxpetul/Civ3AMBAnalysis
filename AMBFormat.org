  AMB files are used by the game Sid Meier's Civilization III. They describe a sound effect as a combination of sound files with randomized effects
  applied. As far as I know these files were created by Firaxis for Civ 3 and never used for anything else.

* Format overview
  An AMB file is made up of many Prgm and Kmap chunks, exactly one Glbl chunk, and exactly one embedded Midi file. AMBs follow the Resource
  Interchange File Format, so every chunk begins with a 4-character identifier followed by a 4-byte integer size. The embedded Midi specifies a time
  offset at which each component sound is to be played. Each component sound corresponds to a Prgm chunk which specifies randomized effects and a
  variable name. Finally the variable name is associated with a sound file name by a Kmap chunk. As far as I can tell, the Glbl chunk contains no
  useful information.

* Endianess and null termination conventions
  Be aware that the AMB files use two different conventions here. Inside the embedded Midi file integers are big endian and strings are not
  null-terminated, while outside the embedded Midi, i.e., in the Prgm, Kmap, and Glbl chunks, integers are little endian and strings are null
  terminated.

* Type definitions
  - tag: Array of 4 ASCII characters
  - int: 4-byte integer. Signedness unknown, but the value contained is positive and too small for it to make a difference
  - signed int: 4-byte integer that is definitely signed
  - short: 2-byte integer
  - str+0: String including null terminator
  - str: String without null terminator
  - vlq: "variable length quantity" from Midi spec. Check the spec for all the details but the jist of it is that a VLQ is a simple compression scheme
    for 4-byte integers. In each VLQ byte, the bottom 7 bits come from the compressed integer and the 8th bit indicates whether or not the next byte
    from the file is also part of the VLQ.
